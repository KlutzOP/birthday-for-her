  <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love ðŸ’•</h1>
  <p>
    Today is your birthday, but in truth, I feel like Iâ€™m the one who should be celebrating â€” because I get to love someone as incredible as you.<br><br>
    From the moment you stepped into my life, everything changed. The world got brighter, quieter, and more beautiful. Your smile, your laugh, your presence â€” they light up even the darkest moments. And now, as I sit here thinking of what to say, I realize words could never fully capture how much you mean to me.<br><br>
    You are warmth in a cold world, calm in my chaos, joy in my routine. You make my days feel like poetry and my nights feel like dreams. Every moment I spend with you feels like a scene from a love story I never believed Iâ€™d be lucky enough to live â€” until I met you.<br><br>
    Today, I just want you to know how incredibly grateful I am for your existence. Not just because you're beautiful, or kind, or smart â€” though you are all those things â€” but because youâ€™re <i>you</i>. Completely and wonderfully you.<br><br>
    Youâ€™ve been my supporter, my comfort, my biggest cheerleader. Youâ€™ve seen me at my best and still held me at my worst. Youâ€™ve believed in me when I didnâ€™t believe in myself. And for that, I love you deeper than I could ever say.<br><br>
    So on your special day, I hope you feel nothing but love. I hope the sky smiles for you, the wind sings your name, and everything around you reminds you how deeply you are loved â€” not just by me, but by the universe that created you.<br><br>
    Happy birthday, my love. Here's to many more birthdays together, more dreams to chase, and memories to create â€” hand in hand, heart to heart.<br><br>
    I love you. Always.
  </p>
